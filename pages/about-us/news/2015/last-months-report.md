platform.

Development highlights
----------------------

The main focus of the development since the last release has being on making
bitmask email awesome. There is still a lot of work to do to become the email
service we want to be, but now we already have something to show on how great
bitmask email can become.

We were neglecting our tests battery and we started a process to make all
green, we now have a buildbot instance that runs tests on every commit and
build the (currently provisional) standalone bundle.

We moved towards building bundles using pyinstaller instead of a custom made
bundler scripts, which allows us to easier achieve multiplatform support.

We spent a fair amount of time refactoring our libraries and apps, we aim to
have cleaner and more maintainable code on each iteration, there is still room
to improvement and we will keep working with this in mind on next releases as
well.

We have being working tirelessly into Soledad, our document syncing service
used to sync emails and keys. Soledad now is faster and more stable. All the
API has being redesigned to be asynchronous. The document downloads now are
performed in parallel. And many other parts has being improved. We still have
many great plans for Soledad and a much work ahead, but now is starting to
become the tool we wanted for bitmask.

To be useful our key management needed a lot of rethinking. We've redesign how
we want to discover and manage OpenPGP keys (and maybe others in the future):
https://leap.se/en/docs/design/transitional-key-validation We have a first
working implementation of it in our KeyManager, and we have plans to improve it
step by step to become a hassle free transparent key manager.
